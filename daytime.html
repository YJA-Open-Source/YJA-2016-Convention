Luckily, we can learn from top businesses and theories of change to answer these questions. We all want to change the world, so let's learn how."></i><br><span>HS</span></h5>

When someone suffers, some Jains think that it is solely due to their Karma. Some think that we should not participate in charity work because if a person commits any sin after we help them, we will acquire their bad Karma. These type of interpretations result in discrediting our Jain religion. This session reviews the practical aspects of the Jain Karma philosophy and will discuss the proper role and true purpose of Karma philosophy."></i><br><span>HS/College</span></h5>

For too long, mental and emotional health issues have been treated as a subject of shame. Change can only happen when we share openly, confront myths and fears, and realize that until we cease hurting ourselves, we cannot truly show compassion to others. 

This session will show us how to understand and value ourselves, expand the conversation on mental health, give us practical tips on self-compassion, and learn how to be that truly supportive ally and friend."></i><br><span>HS/College (16-21)</span></h5>

                        <p>Jainism is a philosophy that believes in self growth. Via its three jewels concept of right vision, right knowledge, and right conduct, it conveys that any individual via clarity, curiosity, and action can progress towards their ultimate goal. This ideal can be applied to not only self improvement, but also social impact. Change complements time. As we shift into the next quarter century of YJA, this convention aims to foster change and growth for the future. The 2016 YJA Convention will focus on providing and manifesting these three jewels to help create progressive change within ourselves and our communities.</p>
